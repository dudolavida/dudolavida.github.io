This quote made me think, why do we do what we do?
When you're trying to find motivation, where do you look?

What is your motivation?
<!-- finish, maybe add on the importance of doing things for your growth and your dreams a not just because you want to prove that you're able to someone else. note: if it's for yourself, then that can be motivating, but also destructive if you don't accept that you might not reach it and that's ok. -->
