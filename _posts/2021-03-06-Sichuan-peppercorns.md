Ever since I had fresh sichuan peppercorns in China, I've found the tingly sensation and mouth numbness pretty awesome.

 Combine that with being tipsy and you've got yourself an interesting combination of sensations. <!-- add here -->

We liked them so much we asked for more ðŸ˜‚And they were so exotic to us, we worried they might be too precious and they wouldn't give us more ðŸ˜…. Soon all our mouths were numb ðŸ˜‹

In cooking, sichuan peppers remind me of the flavour of meaty chinese food, / mapo tofu.

I love making an oil infused with chillies and sichuan peppercorn, from this [recipe][id].
