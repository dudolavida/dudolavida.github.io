I've grown to love sichuan pepper, ever since I had fresh sichuan peppercorns in China.

Peppercorns are pretty awesome and they numb your mouth. Combine this with being tipsy and you've got yourself an intersting combination of feelings. We liked them so much we asked for more ðŸ˜‚And they were so exotic to us, we worried they might be precious and they wouldn't give us more ðŸ˜…. Soon all our mouths were numb ðŸ˜‹

In cooking, sichuan peppers remind me of the flavor of pork / meaty chinese food, / mapo tofu.

I love making the oil infused with chillies and sichuan peppercorn, from this [recipe][id].
