Meal planning? Nah...
<!--more-->
It's all about cooking more!! I started recipe planning in mid-2020. My 5 key steps are:

1. Consult recipe book you trust
2. Pick X recipes for the week ðŸ˜ª#decisions
3. Mark missing ingredients & quantities for shop
4. STUFF the fridge
5. Cook Incessantly
    ... ENJOY! ...

P.s. Organising the list by the store sections & your route through the shop ðŸ¤“, really helps as well ðŸ˜Ž

As I continue to recipe plan in 2021, I've realised that some weeks, my recipe selection is the equivalent of going to the restaurant and wanting/trying to order everything! This has mostly applied to indian recipes, where I've tried to make multiple dishes for each meal, for however many meals I envision having that week (a VERY large number apparently).

It's pretty cool to be cooking stuff that I've never tried before, makes you wonder what it's supposed to taste like/if the consistency is right? ðŸ¤ª
