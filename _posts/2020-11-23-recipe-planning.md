Meal planning? Nah...

It's all about cooking more!! I started recipe planning in mid-2020. My 5 key steps are:

1. Consult recipe book you trust
2. Pick X recipes for the week ðŸ˜ª#decisions
3. Mark missing ingredients & quantities for shop
4. STUFF the fridge
5. Cook Incessantly
    ... ENJOY! ...

P.s. Organising the list by sections in the store & your route through the shop ðŸ¤“, really helps as well ðŸ˜Ž

As I continue to recipe plan in 2021, I've realised that some weeks, my recipe selection feels like going to the restaurant and wanting to order everything! This is mostly true with indian recipes, where you'll make multiple dishes for one meal.

It's pretty cool to be cooking stuff that I've never tried before, makes you wonder what it's supposed to taste like/what the consistency should be?
