Meal planning? Nah...

It's all about cooking more!! I started recipe planning a few months back, 5 key steps:

1. Consult recipe book you trust
2. Pick X recipes for the week 😪#decisions
3. Mark missing ingredients & quantities for shop
4. STUFF the fridge
5. Cook Incessantly
    ... ENJOY! ...

P.s. Organising the list by sections in the store & your route through the shop 🤓, really helps as well 😎
