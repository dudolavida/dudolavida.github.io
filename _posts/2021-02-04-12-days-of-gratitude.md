At the end of 2020, I wanted to practice gratitude and re-value all that 2020 had brought. While resisting a lot of the dialogue I was seeing -> that 2021 would be "better".

`What?`  
-> Appreciate 12 things I was grateful for in 2020.

`How?`  
-> Piggybacking onto the 12 days of Christmas, which run from the 25th of December to the 5th of January. (Who would have known? No, seriously, I had never considered; the song had always been hefty enough... no, I didn't even think to make it singsongy 😅nor did I count things. Gratitude is best non-numeric).
-> Identifying the 12 topics, cleansing the thousands of pictures I had taken in 2020 and posting 12 posts on Instagram one on each day of Christmas.

`Why?`  
-> Reflect on 2020.  
-> Turning away from demanding from the future (resolutions) to sealing the past (gratitude), and readying for life in the present.  
-> Gratitude to counter indignation.  
-> Cleanse my photo library. (>10,000 in 2020 🥲)  
-> Post something on Insta for a change!  
-> Set a yearly habit?
