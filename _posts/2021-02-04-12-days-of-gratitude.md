At the end of 2020, I wanted to practice gratitude and re-value all that 2020 had brought. While countering <!--more-->a lot of the dialogue I was seeing -> that 2021 would be "better".

**What?**
-> Appreciate 12 things I was grateful for in 2020.

**How?**
-> Piggybacking the 12 days of Christmas, which run from the 25th of December to the 5th of January. (Who would have known? No, seriously, I had never considered; the song had always been hefty enoug... no, I didn't even think to make it singsongy ðŸ˜…nor did I count things. Gratitude is best non-numeric).
-> Identifying the 12 topics, cleansing the thousands of pictures I had taken in 2020 and posting 12 posts on Instagram one on each day of Christmas.

**Why?**
-> 1. Reflect on 2020.
-> 2. Turning away from demanding from the future (resolutions) to sealing the past (gratitude), and readying for life in the present.
-> 3. Gratitude to counter indignation.
-> 4. Cleanse my photo library. (>10,000 in 2020 ðŸ¥²)
-> 5. Post something on Insta for a change!
-> 6. Set a yearly habit?
