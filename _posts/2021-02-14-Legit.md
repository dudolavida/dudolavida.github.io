'Doing what you say you will do (or what you expect people expect from you & more?)'

- 1. say less
- 2. do more
- 3. don’t raise false expectations

<!--- I’m all for personal growth, so I think it’s time I take this on board.
(but do I need/care what people think of me? does it affect me having expecations? )--->

I've always had so many different ‘growth’ areas planned*, that I've found it hard to keep on track 🤤 #LegitWannabe

I've been living more closely with my dreams in the day to day**. And more importantly I've learnt to set myself fewer expectations.

And finally, no need to appear LEGIT anyway, other's people's expectations (or [what we think people's expectations are][id2]) need not weigh us down.

*I shan't say anything here that I won’t do...  shhhhhh  

**In 2020, I unknowingly, started a few [2-week 'challenges'][id1] and these helped me get out of the shoulda-woulda-coulda and try new things!
