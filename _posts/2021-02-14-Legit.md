An ex-flatmate has admitted to me.  

Ignoring the minor fact that I'm still quite unsure how to pronounce legit. What does being leg$t mean anyway? Maybe:

'Doing what you say you will do (or what you expect people expect from you & more?)'\*

1. say less, do more
2. avoid excuses
3. donâ€™t raise false expectations

I've always had so many different â€˜growthâ€™ areas planned\*\* ðŸ¤¤, that I've found it hard to keep on track #LegitWannabe

I've been living more closely with my dreams in the day to day\*\*\*. And more importantly I've learnt to set myself fewer expectations.

And finally, no need to appear LEGIT anyway, other people's expectations (or [what we think people's expectations are][id2]) need not weigh us down.

_\*I can talk about doing. And do without thinking... in this high-speed, always on world, what's next?_

_\*\*I shan't say anything here that I wonâ€™t do...  shhhhhh_  

_\*\*\*In 2020, I unknowingly, started a few [2-week 'challenges'][id1] and these helped me get out of the shoulda-woulda-coulda and try new things!_
