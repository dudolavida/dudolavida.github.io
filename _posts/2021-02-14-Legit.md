'Doing what you say you will do (or what you expect people expect from you & more?)'

1. say less
2. do more
3. donâ€™t raise false expectations

I've always had so many different â€˜growthâ€™ areas planned* ðŸ¤¤, that I've found it hard to keep on track #LegitWannabe

I've been living more closely with my dreams in the day to day**. And more importantly I've learnt to set myself fewer expectations.

And finally, no need to appear LEGIT anyway, other's people's expectations (or [what we think people's expectations are][id2]) need not weigh us down.
