Nah, not really.

How can you get bored? When you're connected to a powerful computer that can travel through time and space?

Your brain, from one thought to another, gradually, like rain trickling, coalescing on a window or a pebble skipping along a surface, the ripples undulating across, meeting and smoothening.

Some people tell me: "nah... running's not for me, too boring!"

Now don't get me wrong, I'm as impulsive as they come, happily scrolling through reddit, consuming video frame after frame, and jumping from task to activity to procrastinate along.

By being always online, processing, we rarely remember to defragment our C-drives. Give time to yourself, love yourself.
