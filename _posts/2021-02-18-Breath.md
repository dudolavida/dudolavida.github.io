[Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art][id1] by James Nestor, feels familiar, maybe because we're all breathing creatures ;), but the anedoctal and referential richness inspires the reader to delve (& breathe) deeeper.

Similar to Matthew Walker's [Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams][id2]*, this book is research rich, but I believe James Nestor better combines story with science.

Amidst his new-found insights, he brings us on his journey of discovery, as he himself takes on his breathing!

He shares a lot of wisdom on the topic; which of the following had you come across?

- Nose breathing vs. mouth breathing
- Right nostril vs. left nostril breathing & how it affects our feelings
- The nose is awesome; it can filter, heat, purify air
- Cultural & Religious Practices focussing on long inhales & exhales & how prayer can relax us :)
- Chewing: developing the face through stem cell production in the jaw, preventing bad teeth and bad breath!
- Different nerves in our lungs are triggered when we breathe deeper and softly vs. when we breathe quickly and superficially.**
- And so much more!

I'm starting to believe I'm quite 'gullible', -> barefoot shoes, veganism, sustainability, minimalism, etc. :p

\*I had to put down _Why We Sleep_, as I would often fall asleep reading it :p A few easy reads down the line, I might pick it up again. Though as I mentioned, I often found the science was thrown at me & I would struggle to extract and subsequently remember all that golden knowledge.
\*\* And how the nerves triggered by long calm breaths can help digestion. I've often struggled with tummyaches! And thus have been exploring the topic of mindful eating. Do you sometimes/often find that you've finished a meal and can't really remember having it? And the solution is having more food?
