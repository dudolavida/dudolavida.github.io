#### Winter 1:
Dark upper sixth (last year of high school) -> 3 Movies each night & 4 am bedtime, I lived as a ghost. I needed a girlfriend, I needed appreciation.

-> Language Learning 2013, opportunity to come out of my shell, and enjoy life and have another source of endorphins which gave me a willigness to live/get out and meet people and travel the world. -> extroversion

#### Winter 2:
Dark time at home, I felt lonely despite being with family. I felt I needed social interactions beside my parents. I was attached to my phone and used it to escape, I was courting a girl at a distance, hanging onto the appreciation, I was neither here nor there.

-> The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck, don't focus on what others think. Went local, had a lot of fun and dated a girl locally. Picked up loads of different activities at home: piano, drawing, coding, lots of incomplete udemy classes 😅 -> extroversion

#### Winter 3:
Attachment to others' emotions, living reactively rather than actively. Feelings of indecision and confusion. I wanted to fix things with an ex and return to our intimacy despite the ending of our romantic relationship.

-> Happiness is a choice in every moment. -> Ambivert
