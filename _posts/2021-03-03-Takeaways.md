Most of my 'takeaways' come around when I'm walking along.

Some examples from the week
- the only thing that sticks with you the whole way is your life, love it.
- if we start on a bad, bad, bad, bad.. list, the joint weight pulls us down
- accept that you can’t choose how others act, only how you process it
- smile with your voice <!--(link to passive aggressive...)--->
- you can’t tell a whole existence from one look, all you can do is capture a moment in someone else’s life <!--_(link to a blogpost about categorising people into types and why we do it? (for simplicity? to know how to respond to that person and thus to reduce thinking))_-->
