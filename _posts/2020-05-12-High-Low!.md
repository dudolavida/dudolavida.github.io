I love that sometimes our brains just spell things differently. Say replacing words with their homophones.

I've even caught myself typing completely different words that sound the same, when pronounced, as the one word I had originally intended. Reminds me of a game I recently played with my bemused friend over a video call: reading gibberish and trying to make out actual words/phrases.  It's interesting how the brain works.

How it wanders...
