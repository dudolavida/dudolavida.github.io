I love that sometimes our brains just spell things differently. Say replacing words with their homophones.

I've even caught myself typing completely different words that sound the same, when pronounced, as the one word I had originally intended. Reminds me of a game I recently played with my bemused friend over a video call: reading gibberish and trying to make out actual words/phrases.  It's interesting how the brain works.

How it wanders...
<!-- replace and add around speaking words in your head while writing/reading, and read around th method of reading that doesn't read words in your head aloud, apparently you can erad faster... ummmm)
