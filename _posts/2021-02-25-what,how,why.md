A colleague, trained as a life coach, introduced this method to me as a way to keep-up with your personal goals.

The WHAT might be a goal:         I'm going to learn to fly
The HOW might be the method(s):   _um_.. fluid dynamics?
The WHY might be:                 I believe I can fly, duh!

Your WHY keeps you persistent, engaged, coming back. Your HOW is all the weird-ass things you're going to try and try again. And the WHAT is just a [promise][id2] waiting to be fulfilled.

_WHY-How-what?_

You'll need a good WHY where you're heading. ;) \*

In the [Rules of Thinking][id1] by Richard Templar, in _Rule 88_, he says "Look for the bigger picture in everything you do". It can help with acceptance :)

Similarly what is your bigger picture?
