So what am I doing here?  
-
Trying out some writing!
Why,
exactly?

Well...
I thought it would be a good idea to crack on with some thoughts.
And really,
to see what writing could
bring,
both to
you and me.

Most of my writing,
in the last few years,
has gone
and still goes into
*instant messaging.*
A chance,
to connect with someone and
make them smile,
at a distance.

*And I expect that's true for most people.*

Makes you wonder;
What would you write
about, when
no one
or
everyone
might
be reading?

This dilemma was definitely,
*[one of the many obstacles][id1]*,
I set myself.

-

Now;
I'm just letting it flow.
Why,
write on a particular topic?
After-all,
I'm a jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none.

Writing, can be a means for me to:
- explore my creativity
- focus on and research a topic
- slow down and think things over
- practice writing in foreign languages
- share

Let's do this!

The writing style above reminds me of "Toffee" by Sarah Crossan [Gdrds][id1]|[Amz][id2]
A powerful book on youth, old-age and home. She employs prose and empty space on a page, to let her words sink deep.
