-- _[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (Dirk Gently)][id]_* by Douglas Adams

There is often, one might find, an overlap between the two.

- Status quo is challenged
- Difficult questions may be asked
- There is change
- Attempts at resolving initial trouble can lead to a rippling effect of trouble.

Douglas Adams' writing is magical, it can really get your mind thinking. As you surface from being submerged in physics and Sci-Fi, you slow down to find that his writing is just as powerful, if not more, in describing human behaviour and emotions.

As mentioned in [Salmon of Doubt][id1] **, from an early age, Douglas was attracted to 'intelligent' humour and this is what he has brought to millions, a chance to ponder amongst the unexpected.
