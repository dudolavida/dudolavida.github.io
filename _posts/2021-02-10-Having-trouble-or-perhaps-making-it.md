There is often, one might find, an overlap between the two.

- Status quo is challenged
- Difficult questions may be asked
- There is change
- Attempts at resolving initial trouble can lead to a rippling effect of trouble.

As mentioned in [Salmon of Doubt][id]**, from an early age, Douglas was attracted to 'intelligent' humour and this is what he has brought to millions, a chance to ponder amongst the unexpected.
